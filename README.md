# ‚ò∏Ô∏è Launching a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS EKS

---

## Project Overview  
I deployed my **first Kubernetes cluster** using **Amazon EKS** to gain hands-on experience with container orchestration in the cloud. This project focused on provisioning infrastructure using the CLI (`eksctl`), managing IAM permissions, and understanding how EKS clusters are built and accessed securely.

---

## Project Highlights  

### What I Did:  
- üíª **Set Up EC2 Dev Environment**: Used an EC2 instance as my base to interact with AWS services.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Installed and Used `eksctl`**: Provisioned the EKS cluster using the CLI, which leverages CloudFormation templates.  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Configured IAM Access**: Diagnosed and fixed IAM permission errors that blocked console access to the EKS cluster.  
- üß† **Learned How CloudFormation Supports `eksctl`**: Understood how EKS clusters are automatically built with CloudFormation under the hood.

### Skills  
- Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning  
- IAM Policy & Trust Relationship Configuration  
- CLI Tool Usage (`eksctl`)  
- CloudFormation Infrastructure Insights  
- AWS Role-Based Access Debugging  
- Cloud Security Troubleshooting  
- EC2 Setup for Cloud DevOps

## Why This Project?  
EKS is a powerful way to manage containers in production, but it also requires precise **IAM role configuration** and a good grasp of how AWS services like **CloudFormation** automate infrastructure. This project helped build a strong foundation in container-based cloud architecture and deepened my understanding of **access control** and **DevOps troubleshooting** in AWS.
